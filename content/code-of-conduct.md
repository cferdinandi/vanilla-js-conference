**The Quick Version:** The Vanilla JS Conference is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, and religion (or lack thereof).

We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks and the Slack channel for this event. Speakers and conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference at the discretion of the conference organizers.

## Anti-Harassment

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

- Verbal or written comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion
- Sexual images in public spaces
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
- Harassing photography or recording
- Sustained disruption of talks or other events
- Unwelcome sexual attention
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior

## Enforcement

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, event organizers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the conference.

Event organizers may take action to address anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants. We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social activities. We think people should follow these rules outside event activities, too!

## Reporting

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible. The event organizer, Chris Ferdinandi, can be reached by email at {{<email>}} or by Direct Message in the event Slack channel.

Harassment and other Code of Conduct violations reduce the value of our event for everyone. We want you to be happy at our event. People like you make our event a better place.

Our team will be happy to help you contact local law enforcement, local support services, or otherwise assist you to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.

## Inclusive Language

In our commitment to a harassment-free and inclusive environment we strongly believe it’s important to pay attention to harmful language patterns.

### Ableism

Words like “crazy”, “dumb”, “insane” or “lame” are examples of ableist language, devaluing people who have physical or mental disabilities. Its appearance often stems not from any intentional desire to offend, but from our innate sense of what it means to be normal. These words can be avoided by using more fitting, clearer descriptions of what we want to communicate.

To find out more about ableism and replacement terms please [read this guide](https://www.autistichoya.com/p/ableist-words-and-terms-to-avoid.html).

### Sexism

Using gendered terms like “dude” or “guys” to address a mixed-gendered group of people contributes to furthering exclusion of underrepresented individuals. We strongly advise avoiding gendered pronouns as well as gendered terms.</p>
