## How it works

The entire Vanilla JS Conference is online. There is no separate in-person event. So... how does an _online conference_ actually work?

All of the talks will be streamed to a private site you'll [get access to after you register](#attend). It'll be powered by YouTube Live, so you can **watch on any device with an internet connection**. You won't have to download anything.

One of the most valuable parts of a conference is the networking and conversations that happen around the talks. To help facilitate that, you'll also get access to **a private Slack channel** where other attendees and speakers will be hanging out.
