## About this talk

JavaScript is unarguably the most versatile language these days. In your browser with a <script> tag, in your terminal with Node.js, in a project with some exotic module bundler... catering to everyone is becoming trickier and trickier.

The good news is, it doesn’t have to be.

I’ll show you how I made Dinero.js, a fully automated JavaScript library that you can use in browser and in Node.js, whatever technique or dependency injection system you’re using, and that even supports IE11.
